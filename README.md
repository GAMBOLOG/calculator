I built this responsive calculator as a demo practice project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean modern design, dark/light themes, history with localStorage, keyboard support, and fully responsive layout so it works smoothly on all devices. This project reflects my frontend development skills and my focus on creating user-friendly interfaces.
